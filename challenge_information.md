Game Logic:

- Students attend their mandatory lectures once during the day

- Students do not have out of hours access to buildings

- The ring leader does not have anything inconsistent about their day. They have an air

tight alibi, with the exception that they have met with fellow conspirators.



## Rough Outline of tasks to do 

- Work out who the 6 conspirators are (with data anomalies), and the 1 mastermind who met up with all of them but has clean data

Make creative visualisations with:

- location data

- timeline data 

- people data

Can also merge tables for even more rich visualisations 

The bulk of points will be awarded for visualisation solutions, not actually solving
the case. Finding some accomplices through a generalisable and visually appealing solution
will score higher than those who solve the case in its entirety without attempting any
visualisation methods.
